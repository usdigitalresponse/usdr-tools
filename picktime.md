## Description <a id="h.7w7zez36b1wy"></a>

‚ÄåPicktime is an online scheduling tool to manage appointments across multiple locations, services, and time slots. The system is fully configurable based on the partner needs. There are integrations with other systems via API, a basic web code insertion tool, or you can use simple url links to the tool.

Picktime is a completely free booking tool at this point in time. They state that anyone who does enroll for free will remain free if/when that changes.

You can visit the website and sign up for an account in just a few minutes. There are a handful of questions you have to answer: contact email, type of business, and login info to get started.

## Vendor Support <a id="h.e50orjda7y75"></a>

I did not have the need to contact support, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward to set up and manage.

Vendor does offer video tutorials and a robust help FAQ for reference. There is also a contact mechanism for problems not answered by these resources.

## Maintenance <a id="h.o456lrtyv134"></a>

This tool is very easy to use once the initial setup is complete. The partner should be able to completely take over ownership once the configurations are completed.

### Monitoring <a id="h.mkbsvjvtwwdv"></a>

The tool is pretty simple and doesn‚Äôt really require much monitoring.

The upkeep of the appointment hours and services is the only action required to keep the system running properly.

## Security Level <a id="h.wp27bo5hatdz"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
This tool's security level is: **MEDIUM** - Information or data that is used for USDR internal purposes but should not be disclosed to unauthorized parties outside of USDR. Does not contain personal data or intellectual property information and has no potential legal or regulatory impacts
{% endhint %}

## How I've Used This Tool <a id="h.flwakkvuwzba"></a>

The LA County AJCC wanted to create an online booking system for intake appointments. The purpose was to create an online tool for clients to book virtual appointment times via a weblink on the AJCC website. The system can also be used for in person consultations when the locations are able to accommodate in person appointments as well.

The selection of this tool was based on the ease of use and maintenance for the partner even if they are not very tech savvy.

## üßô‚ôÇ Tips & Tricks <a id="h.wrvy8ngdpil0"></a>

* You should collect the basic configuration information from the client before you start: Locations, Operating Hours, Services provided, contact information \(email and location\) of persons providing services. If you have this up front it will expedite the initial setup process.
* When you create the account, do so in the partner‚Äôs name vs. your own so that they are the owner once you get them up and running.

## Lessons Learned <a id="h.9j1dk9qzdv6e"></a>

\*\*\*\*üèÜ **PROCEED!** What this tool is great for‚Ä¶

* This tool is great for a partner that is looking for a simple and easy to maintain online booking system.
* The time to stand this up is minimal and it meets needs quickly and effectively.

\*\*\*\*üåµ **BEWARE!** What's hard to do with this tool‚Ä¶

* There really weren‚Äôt any challenges that I encountered. I did not set up the API‚Äôs so there may be some pitfalls there.
* It is important to make sure the partner understands it is a fairly new product and there is the risk of them going under but, honestly, the effort to set it up is minimal enough that the reward likely outweighs the risk.

## Other Landmines

‚ÄåNone identified.

## Training Resources <a id="h.jjhr8ylgtcxa"></a>

HOW-TO videos and an FAQ are available.

## Hmm, What Else? <a id="h.citc7idtx8n3"></a>

It‚Äôs worth noting here that you can use Airtable to build a booking system as well. There is a template to get you started in that regard. The challenge is that you have to manually create and maintain the tables and relationships in Airtable over time. The reason we shifted to Picktime was the **significantly low maintenance of the system** once it is configured.
