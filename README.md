# Introduction

**Looking for a software tool for your project?** The USDR Tools Playbook contains a \(growing\) list of vetted commercial-off-the-shelf software tools and a detailed set of guidelines to help you choose the right tool for your project.

USDR volunteers successfully used and examined over 40 tools across a variety of categories. In this playbook, they share how they used a tool, its pros and cons, lessons learned, tips and tricks, as well as limitations. USDR has an account with most of these tools, making it easier to explore their capabilities and build prototypes.

Choosing a tool for a project is no small feat. There are numerous important considerations, so we've listed key questions and created a guideline to help you make a sound selection.

##  üë£ How To Use The Tools Playbook

1. First read the [**Guidelines**](usdr-tool-guidelines/) to understand the various considerations in choosing a tool.
2. Use the list of tools on the left to identify those that match your project needs, create a shortlist and compare them. Work with your partner to present pros and cons in your shortlist, so they can weigh in on prioritizing or deprioritizing features against the capabilities of those tools.
3. If you have experience with, tips, or an update for a tool that you feel may help other volunteers, ****[**share it here**](https://form.jotform.com/210477511316045) so we can add it in its tool page.
4. Find the documentation helpful - or not? Share your sentiment with a smiley at the bottom of every page, so we can improve the content.
5. Please read existing documentation about ****[**all things access, troubleshooting, and IT**](https://www.notion.so/usdr/question-tools-1575f6089b7c46c6bf2bcae8993be474) on Notion.
