# Introduction

**Looking for a tool to support your project?** This playbook contains a list of commercial-off-the-shelf software tools that have been successfully used and vetted at USDR, including their pros and cons, volunteers tips and usage experiences. USDR has an account with most of these tools, making it easier to explore their capabilities and build prototypes.

Choosing a tool for a project is no small feat. There are numerous considerations, so we've listed key questions and created a guideline to help you make a sound selection.

##  üë£ How To Use This Resource

1. First read the [**Guidelines**](usdr-tool-guidelines.md) to understand the various considerations in choosing a tool.
2. Use the list of tools on the left to identify those that match your project needs, create a shortlist and compare them. Work with your partner to present pros and cons in your shortlist, so they can weigh in on prioritizing or deprioritizing features against the capabilities of those tools.
3. If you have experience with, tips, or an update for a tool that you feel may help other volunteers, [share it here](https://form.jotform.com/210477511316045) so we can add it in its tool page.
4. Find the documentation helpful - or not? Give it a thumbs up or down at the bottom of every page, so we can improve the content.
