## Procurement <a id="h.vrqjenfsjq1q"></a>

The basic tier is free. It also offers Premium, Business, and Enterprise tiers.

Asana offers a discount for governments and non-profit organizations. However, some government agencies may have to go through third-party vendors for fast-track procurement and may not be able to take advantage of the non-profit discount.

## How I've Used This Tool <a id="h.flwakkvuwzba"></a>

I have used Asana to manage multiple ongoing projects with different personnel. I create multiple teams, assign users with different roles that restrict edit/access to certain project details. I create a task under each project, assign it to a team member, and add the due date. I create custom fields based on the nature of a project. I receive notifications when someone assigns me a task or tags me in a comment. I upload files and images to a task to share updates with team members. I also create private projects that can be only accessed by me. I create and publish forms for other users to enter information into projects.

## Tips & Tricks \(from USDR users\) <a id="h.doc1gn3ys4e6"></a>

1. The third-party app integration is handy. I use [Slack integration](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://asana.com/apps&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1612549022646000&usg=AOvVaw04c6X7ROMczVEhjhcTjCdw). When someone assigns me a new task or tags me in a comment, I receive a real-time notification in Slack. I can directly respond to an assignment or a comment in Slack without having to open Asana.
2. I check my [Inbox](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/inbox&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1612549022646000&usg=AOvVaw0Q14DxuhLI51B8Bp3Tye9y) regularly so that I keep track of tasks I‚Äôm assigned to or part of.  
3. To look for a specific task, I like using the [Search functionality](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/search&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1612549022647000&usg=AOvVaw3c-XiYobE5f5dW7GXMl46Y).
