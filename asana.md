The basic tier is free. It also offers Premium, Business, and Enterprise tiers.

Asana offers a discount for governments and non-profit organizations. However, some government agencies may have to go through third-party vendors for fast-track procurement and may not be able to take advantage of the non-profit discount.

## How I've Used This Tool <a id="h.flwakkvuwzba"></a>

I have used Asana to manage multiple ongoing projects with different personnel.

1. Create multiple teams, assign users with different roles that restrict edit/access to certain project details.
2. Create a task under each project, assign it to a team member, and add the due date.
3. Create custom fields based on the nature of a project.
4. Receive notifications when someone assigns me a task or tags me in a comment.
5. Upload files and images to a task to share updates with team members.
6. Create private projects that can be only accessed by me.
7. Create and publish forms for other users to enter information into projects.

## 🧙♂ Tips & Tricks \(from USDR users\) <a id="h.doc1gn3ys4e6"></a>

1. The third-party app integration is handy. I use [Slack integration](https://asana.com/apps/slack). When someone assigns me a new task or tags me in a comment, I receive a real-time notification in Slack. I can directly respond to an assignment or a comment in Slack without having to open Asana.
2. I check my [Inbox](https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/inbox) regularly so that I keep track of tasks I’m assigned to or part of.  
3. To look for a specific task, I like using the [Search functionality](https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/search)
