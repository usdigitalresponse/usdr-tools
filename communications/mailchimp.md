In Mailchimp, landing pages live alongside other campaign types. Landing pages are free to all Mailchimp users, so you can build as many as you need.

‌Mailchimp sites can be built with a free account, but some of the best features are a part of the paid tiers. If your government partner uses Mailchimp already or has a paid account, this can be a good option.
