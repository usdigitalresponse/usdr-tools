‌Mailchimp sites can be built with a free account, but some of the best features are a part of the paid tiers. If your government partner uses Mailchimp already or has a paid account, this can be a good option.

## How I've Used This Tool <a id="h.flwakkvuwzba"></a>

‌I created a landing page to register for a roadshow. 

1. Easy to add assets and text boxes
2. Reusable forms to gather information
3. Contact information is stored in Audiences and can be exported as a segment for further reach out.
   1. This data can be exported as an excel with information gathered in the registration form.

## Lessons Learned <a id="h.9j1dk9qzdv6e"></a>

PROCEED! What this tool is great for…  all-in-one tool where you can manage your mailing lists, create custom email templates, and nurture and automate your entire marketing campaigns. 

BEWARE! What's hard to do with this tool …  ‌

* Customize elements within the page that do not confine to their preset elements, e.g., must have text and photo asset - cannot have a video asset uploaded. 
* No customizable fonts - Mailchimp have a limited set that they provide and you cannot download others to use.



\*\*\*\*

## Other Landmines

* While the freemium level is quite generous, the price quickly rises with the subscription plans.
* Limited e-mail automation.
