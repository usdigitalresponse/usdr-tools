## **Security: How sensitive is the data?‌**

Know the security needs and your partner’s security protocol! ‌Does your project deal with private or sensitive data? Ask yourselves these questions:

1. Must the tool be HIPPA/PII/PCI/CCPA/GDPR compliant?
2. Does the tool support 2-factor authentication, allow administrative control for multiple users, have the ability to encrypt sensitive data, etc.?
3. How is the vendor securing the data?
4. Check the vendor site for "data privacy."
5. What is the impact of a security breach? Need a process to manage a breach?
6. Keep in mind you may need to work with the partner’s security team to pass any security audits.
7. Will you be handling Confidential/Public/Internal data? Understanding your partner's data classification
8. Is the tool updated to the latest version?
9. Does the tool provide access management? Will you be alerted if there’s unusual login activity?

## **Certifications and Standards**

1. What compliance certifications does the app have?
2. To what data center standards does the app adhere?

## **Data Protection**

1. Does the app allow data classification \(e.g., public, confidential, proprietary\)?
2. If yes, does the app allow admins to take action on classified data \(e.g., encrypt, control access\)?
3. Does the app encrypt data-at-rest?
4. Does the app encrypt data-in-transit?

## **Access Control**

1. Does the app support role-based authorization?
2. Does the app enforce authorization policies on user activities?
3. Does the app support access control by IP address or range?
4. Does the app enforce password best practices as policy?
5. Does the app support multi-factor authentication?

## **Auditability**

1. Does the app provide admin audit logs?
2. Does the app provide user audit logs?
3. Does the app provide data access audit logs?

## **Business Continuity**

Does the app vendor provide notifications to customers about upgrades and changes \(e.g., scheduled maintenance, new releases, software/hardware changes\)?
