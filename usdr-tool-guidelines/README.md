## **How to choose the right tool**

Your team or partner needs a tool to fill a need and after browsing online or through the list of USDR-vetted tools, you spotted what seems like the perfect tool for your project.‌ But wait! Have you considered security requirements in case the data handled is sensitive? Do you know how and who will maintain the tool after handover to your partner, especially if they don’t have a technical team onsite? Is there a cost up front or through maintenance? Not sure what else to consider? We’ve got you. 

‌‌Use the below list of Vetting Considerations to weigh in on the technical needs of your project and partner.

### **Prioritize, prioritize**

You may find that no one tool really hits the nail on the head.

‌If no tool fits all needs, prioritize the requirements. You may not get EVERY requirement but you may get the most important ones. Thoroughly discuss this with your partner.

1. If able, play with the tools and build a prototype. You can show this to your partner as part of your vetting.
2. Compile a short list of possible tools with pros/cons and a demo \(if possible\) and present to your partner for their consideration.
   1. If the partner already has a license for a tool that is on par with the other options, default to that.
   2. Otherwise, if it's not clear which tool is the best choice and there are significant tradeoffs between them, work with the partner to prioritize key features, and proceed by elimination of unfit tools.

### **Prefer low-code or no-code tools**

We highly recommend leaning towards using a Commercial off-the-shelf \(COTS\) software tool before going the [build-it-ourselves route](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-lxhrZPtFNyydbk-m52Uycj5Kovduss17bSdwzcklE/edit#heading=h.zchlscy5p4f9). COTS products are “low code/no code” packaged solutions, adapted to satisfy the needs of the purchasing organization.   


> The advantages to using COTS tools include potentially short timeline from acquisition to usage, no long term maintenance requirements that often accompany custom solutions, and sometimes minimal or no hosting concerns \(if the COTS is cloud-based\).

First consider the USDR list of off-the-shelf software tools in this Playbook, that have already been vetted through the Operations & Tools Team. For the most part, these tools are available, powerful, cheap, and easily accessible. In many cases, USDR has already worked with the vendor to set up account access for volunteers.

If you feel you need a tool not on the list, consider the following vetting strategy. Then, contact the[ Operations & Tools team](https://www.notion.so/usdr/Operations-Tools-Team-b98408c4f41648fd90065db74c4d3ab7) to work through the vetting, approval, and procurement of the tool.

**Building a custom tool**

After careful consideration of off-the-shelf tools, you and the partner are left with no other choice than building your own custom tool: please [follow these guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-lxhrZPtFNyydbk-m52Uycj5Kovduss17bSdwzcklE/edit#heading=h.zchlscy5p4f9).

## **Vetting Considerations**

### **Partner Requirements**

It is imperative to understand your partner’s tool requirements.

1. Don’t rely on just what they tell you up front – dig a bit deeper to uncover any other needs they didn’t consider or realize they needed. Ask leading questions and about current scenarios. 
2. It is also helpful to prioritize the needs from got-to-have-it through nice-to-have. 
3. Cover all stakeholders – internal and external. 
4. Determine communication needs -  e.g., phone, website, app, email and/or text reminders \(via SMS\), internal/external dashboards, emergency alerts. 
5. Does the partner require metrics to monitor usage, issues, status, etc.?
6. HINT: A process map helps the partner visualize what they will get! It can help eliminate misunderstandings and unrealistic expectations. 

### **Procurement**

1. Does the partner already have the tool? Does the partner have any budget constraints with regards to paying a tool \(building, maintenance, upgrade fees, etc\)? See our recommendation for off-the-shelf tools \(ANCHOR to COTS section above\)
2. How long does it take to procure the tool and does it fit the project timeline? If the procurement process is long and involved, is there a way to short-cut the process?**‌**

### **Reliable vendor**

Having a reliable and known vendor is a plus!

1. Is the product under active development and is in widespread use \(this indicates the vendor continues to deliver value and respond to market needs\)?
2. Is the COTS highly mature in the marketplace?
3. Have similar organizations successfully implemented the solution \(with “success” determined by end users, not by the vendor\).

### **Security: How sensitive is the data?‌**

Know the security needs and your partner’s security protocol! ‌Does your project deal with private or sensitive data? Ask yourselves these questions:

1. Must the tool be HIPPA/PII/PCI/CCPA/GDPR compliant?
2. Does the tool support 2-factor authentication, allow administrative control for multiple users, have the ability to encrypt sensitive data, etc.?
3. How is the vendor securing the data?
4. Check the vendor site for "data privacy."
5. What is the impact of a security breach? Need a process to manage a breach?
6. Keep in mind you may need to work with the partner’s security team to pass any security audits.
7. Will you be handling Confidential/Public/Internal data? Understanding your partner's data classification
8. Is the tool updated to the latest version?
9. Does the tool provide access management? Will you be alerted if there’s unusual login activity?

\*\*\*\*[**Other important security considerations**](data-security.md)\*\*\*\*

Security is paramount. If you have any question, please reach out to USDR security point of contact   [Kevin Tan](mailto:kevin.tan@usdigitalresponse.org).

### **‌Try The Tool!**

A free trial period is preferred so your team can fully vet the tool and its functionality. Is a demo or trial available? Be sure to play with the tool and, if possible, build a prototype with false data to show the features.

### **Support**

Understand all internal/external support needs.

1. What type of support does the vendor offer?
2. What do you need now during the project?
3. What will the partner need after hand-over?

### **Interoperability**

1. Can the tool integrate with the partner's system\(s\) and other required tools? Identify any other systems which the tool will need to integrate with.
2. Test all necessary integrations.

### **Deployment**

‌Where and to whom does the tool need to be deployed? 

1. How easy is the tool to deploy? What are the steps required?
2. Is the partner equipped to take over the solution?
3. Need a helpline for users during deployment?
4. Would a phased deployment work best to work out the kinks?
5. Can future upgrades be automated?**‌**

### **Hand-off**

Can the project be easily handed off to the partner?

1. From a USDR point of view, can the project be easily handed off to the partner?
2. What are the steps required in the hand off?
3. Is the partner willing and able to follow these steps?

### **Training & Resources**

Does the tool have embedded training or a guide?

1. What kind of training is needed for the partner's team? Technical for handling issues/upgrades? Administrative? General user? Executive user? Subject Matter Expert user? Train-the trainer user? Hand-over? Other?
2. Training delivery? Online live, recorded, etc.

### **Maintenance & Monitoring**

You’ll want to anticipate what maintenance looks like after hand-off and what type of monitoring is required from the partner, so they are prepared.

‌Does the partner have an IT team?

1. If YES, does the team have or can they gain expertise in the tool? Can they, and do they want to maintain the tool after handoff, including any integration issues with other tools?
2. If NO, can a non-technical team maintain the tool after handoff?
3. How reliable is the tool when left alone?
4. Is it easy to detect and address errors/issues?

### **Landmines**

Other areas to watch out for and ask yourself include:

1. Are there important features in the tool that are known to work poorly or are too complex to use? If so, can they be easily revised?
2. Is the tool accessible?
3. Does the tool support the languages the partner needs now and in the future?
4. Data:
   1. Does the partner own the data? 
   2. Can the data be easily migrated in the future in a standard, machine-readable format?**‌**

### **‌Build your own custom tool**

Here are important considerations for building your own open source, customized tool.

While we highly encourage the use of existing tools, there are also good reasons to consider building your own tool. If you are facing this choice, please reach out to the[ Operations & Tools team](https://www.notion.so/usdr/Operations-Tools-Team-b98408c4f41648fd90065db74c4d3ab7) to help support this route. Below are a few reasons to build a custom solution:

* The COTS solution will require change requests or customization.
* ‌The required COTS customization breaks the ability to apply routine software upgrades and patches.
* ‌The vendor owns modifications to a COTS system.
* ‌The COTS software comes with the baggage of having to support a suite of features that the organization will never use. Large COTS platforms can leave agencies paying for large licensing costs to support unused capabilities.
* ‌The COTS vendor is not transparent about maintenance costs for modifications, migration of existing data, ownership of agency data, or how to export agency data when the contract ends. 
* No other organization has successfully implemented the COTS solution in a situation that is similar to the one the team is facing.
