# Guidelines

### **How do you know if you're choosing the right tool?** 

Your team needs a tool or your partner needs a tool to fill a need. 

Consider a COTS before going the build-it-ourselves route. COTS is a Commercial off-the-shelf or commercially available off-the-shelf products are packaged solutions which are then adapted to satisfy the needs of the purchasing organization, rather than the commissioning of custom-made, or bespoke, solutions. LOW CODE/NO CODE is the optimal choice as along as it fits the project/partner needs.

You browsed through the list of tools and spotted what seems like the perfect tool for your project. 

But wait! Have you considered security needs? Do you know how and who will maintain the tool after handover to your partner? Is there a cost up front or through maintenance? Not sure what else to consider? --- We've got you! 

Use the below TOOL VETTING STRATEGY below to weigh in on the needs of your project and partner. There is also short list a the most popular tools to consider that are already vetted through the tools/op team. For the most part, these tools are available, powerful, cheap, and easily accessible.  In many cases, USDR has already worked with the vendor to set up access for our volunteers.

If you feel you need a tool not on the list, consider the following vetting strategy and read \* below. Then, contact the [**Operations & Tools team**](https://www.notion.so/usdr/Operations-Tools-Team-b98408c4f41648fd90065db74c4d3ab7)  to work through the vetting, approval, and procurement of the tool.  

### **TOOL VETTING STRATEGY: USDR Decision Tree**

**GATHER PARTNER REQUIREMENTS:** It is imperative to understand your partner‚Äôs tool requirements. 

1. Don‚Äôt rely on just what they tell you up front ‚Äì dig a bit deeper to uncover any other needs they didn‚Äôt consider or realize they needed. Ask: 

   1. leading questions, 
   2. for some scenarios of how they see it working \(user stories\), 
   3. about what they do now - what works and what doesn‚Äôt work, about where they see this going in the future \(i.e., future needs\), etc. 

   It is also helpful to prioritize the needs from got-to-have-it through nice-to-have. This will help you triage tools and set up your project schedule. Also, determine the tools they already use - you may be able to use them as is or with a little tweaking. _Double bonus when you can get the job done with existing tools!! ****_

2. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS: Remember to cover all stakeholders ‚Äì internal     \(users, support, developers, etc.\) and external \(customer, general public, outside agencies, etc.\). What are the communication needs? e.g., phone, website, app, email and/or text reminders \(via SMS\), internal/external dashboards, emergency alerts. It helps to draw a process map of the ideal process! It can help eliminate misunderstandings and unrealistic expectations. Does the partner require metrics to monitor usage, issues, status, etc.?

**CHOOSING A TOOL:** Determine the best tool\(s\) for the job. How? Your team needs to research a tool‚Äôs capabilities plus review the tool for each of the following in this list. The best choice is a COTS that does not need customization to fulfill your partner‚Äôs needs. BUT you may find that none really hit the nail on the head.

1. If no tool fits all needs, prioritize the requirements. You may not get EVERY requirement but you may get the most important ones. Thoroughly discuss this with your partner.
2. If able, play with the tools and build a prototype. You can show this to your partner as part of your vetting. 
3. Compile a short list of possible tools with pros/cons and a demo \(if possible\) and present to your partner for their consideration. The final choice should be theirs as they will be dealing with the tool long after your team is gone. 

**VENDOR CONSIDERATIONS:** Having a reliable and known vendor is a plus! 

1. Is the product under active development and is in widespread use \(this indicates the vendor continues to deliver value and respond to market needs\)? 
2. Is the COTS highly mature in the marketplace? 
3. Have similar organizations successfully implemented the solution \(with ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù determined by end users, not by the vendor\). 

**FUNCTIONALITY:** The best tools are simple and intuitive. 

1. Is the language familiar and easy to understand? 
2. Are there obvious SAVE and EXIT points throughout the process? 
3. Is there online help or a bot? 

**PROCUREMENT:** Don't forget the procurement process and roadblocks.

1. Does the partner already have the tool? If not, determine the procurement threshold: cost not an issue, low cost, or free. 
2. How long does it take to procure the tool and does it fit the project timeline? If the procurement process is long and involved, is there a way to short-cut the process?

**DATA OWNERSHIP:** Make sure your partner retains ownership of any data that is entered into or created by analyses or other data manipulation.

**SECURITY:** Know the security needs and your partner‚Äôs security protocal!! 

1. Does your project deal with private or sensitive data? 
2. Must it be HIPPA compliant? 
3. Does the tool support 2-factor authentication, allow administrative control for multiple users, have the ability to encrypt sensitive data, etc.? 
4. How is the vendor securing the data? 
5. Check the vendor site for "data privacy." 
6. What is the impact of a security breach? Need a process to manage a breach?
7. Keep in mind you may need to work with the partner‚Äôs security team to pass any security audits. 
8. If you need further support, please reach out to the USDR security point of contact. **\(ACCURATE CONTACT?\) NOTE:** New tools not already vetted with USDR must go through a security check. Contact the USDR security point of contact. **\(IS THIS ACCURATE?\)**

**DEMO/TRIAL:**  A free trial period is preferred so your team can fully vet the tool and its functionality. Is a demo or trial available?

**SUPPORT:** Understand all internal/external support needs.

1. Does the tool provide "sufficient" support? 
2. What do you need now during the project? 
3. What will you partner need in the future after hand-over?

**INTEROPERABILITY:** Can the tool integrate with the partner's system\(s\) and other required tools?

**DEPLOYMENT:** A bad deployment will overshadow any good the tool does!

1. Where and to whom does the tool need to be deployed? 
2. How easy is the tool to deploy? 
3. Need a helpline for users during deployment? 
4. Would a phased deployment work best to work out the kinks? 
5. Can future upgrades be automated? 

**HAND-OFF TO PARNER:** A bad hand-off will negate a good project!

1. From a USDR point of view, can the project be easily handed off to the partner? 
2. What are the steps required in the hand off? 
3. Is the partner willing and able to follow these steps?

**TRAINING:** Does the tool have embedded training or a guide?

1. What kind of training is needed for the partner's team? Technical for handling issues/upgrades? Administrative? General user? Executive user? Subject Matter Expert user? Train-the trainer user? Hand-over? Other?
2. Training delivery? Online live, recorded, etc. 

**MAINTENANCE:** What does maintenance look like?

1. Does the partner have an IT team? 
2. If YES, does the team have or can gain the expertise in the tool? Can they maintain the tool after handoff, including any integration issues with other tools? 
3. If NO, can a non-technical team maintain the tool after handoff?

**MONITORING:** Your project may be over but your partner needs to understand the monitoring requried.

1. How reliable is the tool when left alone? 
2. Is it easy to detect and address errors/issues? 

**PLAY WITH THE TOOL:** Be sure to play with the tool before recommending it. If possible, build a prototype with false data to show the features.

**LANDMINES:** Other things to consider.

1. Are there important features in the tool that are known to work poorly or are too complex to use? If so, can they be easily revised? 
2. Is the tool accessible? 
3. Does the tool support the languages the partner needs? 
4. Can the data be easily migrated in the future?

### **‚Äå\*Considerations for building your own open source, customized tool:**

Here are some reasons to consider building your own tool BUT, for obvious reasons, USDR discourages building unique tools. If you are facing this choice, please reach out to the [**Operations & Tools team**](https://www.notion.so/usdr/Operations-Tools-Team-b98408c4f41648fd90065db74c4d3ab7)  to vet the reasons for going this route. 

-       The COTS solution will require change requests or customization.

-       The required COTS customization breaks the ability to apply routine software upgrades and patches.

-       The vendor owns modifications to a COTS system. 

-       The COTS software comes with the baggage of having to support a suite of features that the organization will never use. Large COTS platforms can leave agencies paying for large licensing costs to support unused capabilities. 

-       The COTS vendor is not transparent about maintenance costs for modifications, migration of existing data, ownership of agency data, or how to export agency data when the contract ends. No other organization has successfully implemented the COTS solution in a situation that is similar to the one the team is facing.
