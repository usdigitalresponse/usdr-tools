## ‚ÄåProcurement <a id="h.go61rzbnc73"></a>

‚ÄåJotForm has both free and paid tiers. The most expensive plan is $79/month, but is overkill for all but the most heavyweight use cases. The $29/month plan supports 10,000 form submissions, and will be sufficient in almost all cases. See [https://www.jotform.com/pricing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jotform.com/pricing&sa=D&ust=1611865562622000&usg=AOvVaw3TjLVYw3x7ipM7nqjz-CBz) for details.

## Vendor Support <a id="h.e50orjda7y75"></a>

I‚Äôve never actually needed  to contact their support. There is a pretty rich amount of information available via Google as they have many forum posts. They appear to be quite responsive in that setting.

## Maintenance <a id="h.o456lrtyv134"></a>

JotForm requires very little maintenance. While we have seen them experience the occasional outage, there‚Äôs not a great deal you need to do unless your form hits one of the paid plan limits.

### Monitoring <a id="h.mkbsvjvtwwdv"></a>

JotForm can generally just be left on its own without hitting any issues, as long as you don‚Äôt hit one of the paid plan limits.

## How I've Used This Tool <a id="h.flwakkvuwzba"></a>

* To import a PDF and use JotForm to fill out the PDF \(and then use Power Automate to link that PDF to SharePoint\)
* To build a number of wizard/screener flows that don‚Äôt actually anticipate a form being submitted at all, but instead use JotForm‚Äôs programmatic capabilities
* To build a number of longer, multi-page intake forms
* JotForm has many plugins, including the ability to do scheduling and take payment information, but I have not used those.

## Lessons Learned <a id="h.9j1dk9qzdv6e"></a>

{% hint style="success" %}
PROCEED! What this tool is great for:
{% endhint %}

For almost any basic form task, JotForm is quite good.

JotForm is a great tool to prototype any Form or Form-like flow to show what is possible to a government partner. Often, building a form is expected to be hard, but JotForm makes it easy. JotForm also makes it look good. Customizing JotForm to have the look-and-feel of our partners is pretty easy, and can make for a really quick win when creating a demo.

It is very easy to build a JotForm for a partner and then transfer the form to them by cloning the form through the ‚ÄúCreate Form\|Import Form‚Äù workflow, so you don‚Äôt need to have access to their JotForm account just to build the form.

The ‚Äúone question at a time‚Äù flow is very good for wizards/screeners.

JotForm makes it easy to integrate with AirTable \(and has more powerful form functionality - particularly the programmability - than AirTable\) as well as other tools, so it is a good module in a larger suite of SaaS tools.

JotForm has the ability to import a PDF, and then produce a filled version of that PDF. This can be a good way to quickly digitize the intake process for workflows that are currently paper based.

{% hint style="danger" %}
BEWARE! What's hard to do with this tool:
{% endhint %}

It is more difficult to build wizards/screening questions in the single page version of the form - but this is generally solvable by using the one-question-at-a-time process.

JotForm may not be a good tool if your partner already has access to a different form builder - e.g. Cognito Forms.

JotForm may not be a good fit if you only need to build simple forms, and you are using a product like AirTable \(or GSuite\) that has its own forms, and they are good enough for what you need to do. JotForm introduces another procurement hurdle, and another tool to integrate. That being said, JotForm‚Äôs user experience is also nice, so even in those cases, you find it is a good choice.

### Other Landmines <a id="h.595aawa0ekya"></a>

Getting files uploaded to JotForm via Power Automate is very tedious and challenging.

## Training Resources <a id="h.jjhr8ylgtcxa"></a>

I can‚Äôt recommend any because I never needed one. I find the JotForm UI to be pretty intuitive, and most questions can be answered by Googling.

## Hmm, What Else? <a id="h.citc7idtx8n3"></a>

‚ÄåIn my opinion, JotForm is the go to form builder for USDR at the moment. While there might be better tools out there that we should consider, of all the form builders we‚Äôve used, I think it‚Äôs the best.
